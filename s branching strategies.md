# DEVOPS BRANCHING STRATEGIES

In any DevOps environment, version control is one of the primary components of the DevOps pipeline. 

It effectively allows the following:
~~~
- Managing all the source code changes
- Tracking all code changes
- Enabling multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously

However, if these repositories are not managed properly, they can quickly become bloated and
unwieldy, defeating the essential purpose of source control. One of the best ways to keep
everything organized is by adhering to a proper branching strategy for all your development needs.
