# DEVOPS BRANCHING STRATEGIES

In any DevOps environment, version control is one of the primary components of the DevOps pipeline. 

It effectively allows the following:
~~~
- Managing all the source code changes
- Tracking all code changes
- Enabling multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously

However, if these repositories are not managed properly, they can quickly become bloated and
unwieldy, defeating the essential purpose of source control. One of the best ways to keep
everything organized is by adhering to a proper branching strategy for all your development needs.
~~~

# What is a branching strategy?

~~~
Simply put, a branching strategy is something a software development team uses when interacting
with a version control system for writing and managing code. As the name suggests, the branching
strategy focuses on how branches are used in the development process.
One major purpose of a version control system is to enable a collaborative development
environment without overlapping or affecting the codebase. There, each team member modifying
the same source code will inevitably be making conflicting code changes. However, we can avoid
such conflicts with a version control system by using branches when writing and merging code to a
master branch to create the end product.

# Why you need a branching strategy in DevOps

~~~
A properly implemented branching strategy will be the key to creating an efficient DevOps process.
DevOps is focused on creating a fast, streamlined, and efficient workflow without compromising the
quality of the end product.
A branching strategy helps define how the delivery team functions and how each feature,
improvement, or bug fix is handled. It also reduces the complexity of the delivery pipeline by
allowing developers to focus on developments and deployments only on the relevant
branchesâ€”without affecting the entire product.

# Selecting a branching strategy

The selection process for a branching strategy depends entirely on the users and the project
requirements. Factors like the development method, scale, user preferences highly impact this
selection. Additionally, other factors like CI/CD tools decide what branching strategies can be used
in your DevOps pipeline

Branching strategies that do not align or make it more difficult to implement Continuous Integration
and Continuous Delivery in DevOps pipelines should not be used in a DevOps environment.

A good branching strategy should have the following characteristics:

~~~
Provides a clear path for the development process from initial changes to production
Allows users to create workflows that lead to structured releases
Enables parallel development
Optimizes developer workflow without adding any overhead.
Enables faster release cycles
Efficiently integrates with all DevOps practices and tools such as different version control
systems
Offers the ability to enable GitOps (if you require it)
